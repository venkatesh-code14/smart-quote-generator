### ## About The Project

This project was built to practice and showcase core front-end development skills without relying on any external frameworks. It started as a simple idea for a random quote generator and evolved into a more complex application with a focus on creating a polished and interactive user experience.

The application is completely self-contained, using a local library of quotes and backgrounds for a fast and reliable experience.

### ## Key Features

* ** Mood-Based Themes:** A permanent sidebar allows users to select a mood (Motivational, Happy, Love, or Wisdom). The app then provides a relevant quote and a beautiful, themed `linear-gradient` background.
* **  Persistent Favorites:** Users can save their favorite quotes with a single click. The app uses **`localStorage`** to remember these favorites, so they are still available even after the user closes and reopens the browser.
* ** Polished UI:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging, with smooth, cross-fading background transitions and a clean, responsive layout.
* **ðŸ”— Share Functionality:** Users can easily copy a quote to their clipboard or share it on social media.
